Lap bar and rotor mechanism stayed in place. Train and guest went through nomal ride cycle and unloaded at the station area. It appears that all 6 bolts that hold the casing on became loose and fell out allowing the casing to come off the train. We believe it is possible that the bolts were incorrectly tightened during the assembly process from the winter rehab. After checking all other casing mechanisms on both trains it appeared to be an isolated occurrence. We reinspected each lap bars rachet casing bolts on both trains and reinstalled that one that came off. All devices were inspected prior to the ride reopening. We have requested from Philadelphia Toboggan to allow us to change from the current star lock washer to a two tab washer on these 6 bolts.
